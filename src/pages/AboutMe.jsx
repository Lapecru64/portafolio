        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Laura PÃ©rez Cruz. I am a person who is passionate about technology and enjoys tackling challenges. My goal is to assist others in solving their problems and meeting their technological needs.</p>
        <p>As a full-stack developer, I specialize in crafting websites that encompass both the customer experience design (front end) and the programming and maintenance of the site's internal architecture (back end).</p>
        <p>The front end involves designing a website, ranging from its structure to styles like colors, backgrounds, sizes, and animations.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the backend processes the data that feeds the frontend. It represents the hidden technological logic that powers a web page.</p>
        <p>While I have a preference for backend development, I enjoy challenges, so any aspect of web development excites me.</p>
